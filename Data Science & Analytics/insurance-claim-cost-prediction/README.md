# Insurance Claim Cost Prediction

## Overview
Accurate estimation of insurance claim costs is critical for pricing policies and managing financial risk.
This project predicts medical insurance charges using demographic and health-related attributes.

## Objectives
- Analyze factors affecting insurance costs
- Build regression models for cost prediction
- Interpret model results for business insights

## Dataset
Medical insurance dataset containing:
- Age
- Sex
- BMI
- Number of children
- Smoking status
- Region
- Insurance charges (target variable)

## Approach
1. Data understanding and cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Regression modeling
5. Model interpretation

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Ridge & Lasso Regression
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting / XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

## Key Insights (To be updated)
- Smoking status significantly increases insurance cost
- Higher BMI and age correlate with higher charges
- Tree-based models outperform linear models

## Business Impact
The model can help insurance companies price policies more accurately, reduce risk,
and identify high-cost customer segments.


## Future Improvements
- Add uncertainty estimation
- Deploy as pricing API
- Incorporate medical history features
